# Performance measurements of tuner servers

The performance metrics described in
[this page](https://github.com/mirakc/mirakc#8-ts-streams-at-the-same-time) were collected by
using the following command executed on a local PC:

with the following environment:

* Tuner Server
  * ROCK64 (DRAM: 4GB)
    * The script above cannot work with Mirakurun running on ROCK64 (DRAM: 1GB)
      due to a lack of memory as described in the previous section
  * [Armbian]/Buster, Linux rock 4.4.182-rockchip64
  * [px4_drv] a1b81c3f76bab5182370cb41216bff964a24fd21@master
    * `coherent_pool=4M` is required for working with PLEX PX-Q3U4
  * Default `server.workers` (4 = the number of CPU cores)
  * `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2`
* Tuner
  * PLEX PX-Q3U4
* Docker
  * version 19.03.1, build 74b1e89
  * Server processes were executed in a docker container

where a Prometheus server was running on the local PC.

[measure.sh](./measure.sh) performs:

* Receiving TS streams from 4 GR and 4 BS services for 10 minutes
  * `cat` is used as post-filter
* Collecting system metrics by using [Prometheus] and [node_exporter]
* Counting the number of dropped TS packets by using [node-aribts]

The script should be run when the target server is idle.

You can spawn a Prometheus server using a `docker-compose.yml` in the
[docker/prometheus](../docker/prometheus) folder if you have never used it
before.  See [this document](../docker/prometheus/README.md) in the folder
before using it.

Several hundreds or thousands of dropped packets were sometimes detected during
the performance measurement.  The same situation occurred in Mirakurun.
